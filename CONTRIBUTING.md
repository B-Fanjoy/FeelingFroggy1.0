## Branches

**Do not push changes to the `main` branch.**

Branches in Git allow us to work on multiple different versions of the game, and combine the work when we are ready to do so.

Create a separate branch from the `main` branch to work on when working on an issue. For example: `feature-tongue-mechanics`, `fix-tongue-stuck`

*If you do not know much about branches, [this could be a good read](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches).*

## Pull Requests

When your work is ready to be added to the `main` branch, create a pull request. This way problems can be identified and resolved before becoming part of the branch everyone works from.

Once someone has reviewed the pull request and approved the changes, you can merge the pull request.
